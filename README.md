# ABOUT ME
Hi there! My name is Aaron, and I am excited to share a little bit about myself with you. I am a male who loves video game sites. When I'm not making video game sites, you can usually find me gaming

I am a front-end developer, and I am passionate about HTML5 and math. I believe that if you try hard enough you will reach your dreams, and I am always eager to learn more and improve my skills.

In my personal life, I strive to be kind, empathetic, and understanding towards others. I value my family, and I try to live my life in a way that reflects those values. I also enjoy playing Valorant with my friends, and I believe that spending time with loved ones is one of the most important things we can do.

Overall, I am just a very smart person who is trying to make the most out of life. I am grateful for all of the opportunities that I have had, and I am excited to see what the future holds. Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me!
